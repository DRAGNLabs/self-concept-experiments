# Schemer axis and reward hacking: findings

Started 2026-10-02. Plan: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## Writing conventions

One dated section per analyzed run, newest first, placed after "Current status". Each section states the result
first, then the question, the setup (job IDs, artifact paths, vector and cohort hashes), the measurements, and the
limits. Separate what was observed from how it is explained. Pending work stays in PLAN.md. A conclusion that a later
run overturns is marked superseded, not deleted.

Do not call a direction "the schemer direction" until it has passed the Phase 1 validation checks. Do not call a
drop in hack rate reduced reward hacking when hidden-suite pass rate, no-code rate or truncation moved with it. Do
not call a result that is not distinguishable from random directions an association with this direction, and do not
call a non-significant result evidence of no effect.

## Current status

2026-10-07: no results yet. Infrastructure is in place and two smoke jobs are queued on the standby H200 partition:

- Phase 1 smoke (`schemer-extract`, job 14016713): all six roles, 3 questions × 5 prompts each, to check the pipeline
  end to end and to see the judge's score distribution for the honest roles before the full run.
- Phase 3 smoke (`schemer-rh-smoke`, job 14016912): layer norms over the 45 hard-problem prompts, then 3 unsteered
  episodes on the HF backend with the recipe settings, to measure throughput and check the HF path works at all.

Code added (uncommitted on branch `random-vectors-rh`): role files `data/roles/*.json`; `slurm/extract_roles.sbatch`;
`scripts/build_vectors.py`, `scripts/validate_vectors.py`; `selfconcept.correlation.direction_analysis` (Phase 2, CPU);
`selfconcept.measurement.intervene` (add / cap hooks), `selfconcept.codebench.hf_harmony` (HF Harmony generator with
reasoning and projection sidecars), `scripts/steered_rh.py` and `slurm/steered_rh_smoke.sbatch` (Phase 3). Unit tests
in `tests/test_direction_analysis.py` and `tests/test_intervene.py` pass on a tiny model.

| Question | Status | Answer so far |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Is there a usable schemer direction in gpt-oss-120b? | not started | — |
| 2. Does it separate hack from non-hack episodes? | not started | — |
| 3. Does shifting or capping along it change the hack rate? | not started | — |

## Runs

### Tool check — 2026-10-07: `direction_analysis` reproduces the Assistant-Axis numbers on the cached cohort, and the best possible layer-17 direction reaches AUROC 0.77 (CoT) / 0.93 (final)

Not a schemer result. Run on the login node (CPU, ~1 min) with the AA as the candidate and an isotropic random
direction (seed 99) as the "reference", `--random-count 256 --bootstrap 200`. The AA cells match the 2026-10-01
analysis: prompt 0.525, CoT 0.696 (tail 0.054), final 0.714 (tail 0.304), problem/family/turn strata.

New reference numbers for later comparison (same strata):

| Region | Held-out diff-of-means AUROC (ceiling) | AA cos with diff-of-means (random tail) |
|---|---:|---|
| prompt | 0.592 | 0.030 (0.12) |
| cot | 0.765 | 0.119 (0.004) |
| final | 0.929 | −0.038 (0.05) |

The ceiling is a hack-minus-non-hack mean direction fit with the scored problem's transcripts held out; it uses the
labels, so it is an upper reference for any single layer-17 direction on this cohort, not a vector of interest.
In the CoT region the AA is more aligned with that direction than 255 of 256 random directions are, which is a
different statement from "the AA predicts hacks better than random directions" (tail 0.054 there).

## Background: the baseline this study compares against

Not a result of this study. From the random-vector control of 2026-10-01 (branch `random-vectors-rh`, output in
`~/nobackup/autodelete/rh-random-control-v3/full/analysis/`): Assistant-Axis projection vs reward hacking on
gpt-oss-120b at layer 17, 824 transcripts (189 HACK, 635 unflagged), 41 problems, hacks compared with non-hacks of
the same problem, run family and turn, against 256 isotropic random directions.

| Region | Pairs | AA AUROC | Random 2.5 / 50 / 97.5% | Tail fraction | Token-count AUROC | Residual-norm AUROC |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| prompt | 868 | 0.525 | 0.430 / 0.499 / 0.571 | 0.54 | 0.487 | 0.497 |
| cot | 867 | 0.696 | 0.311 / 0.504 / 0.691 | 0.044 | 0.442 | 0.565 |
| final | 868 | 0.714 | 0.145 / 0.504 / 0.849 | 0.29 | 0.544 | 0.116 |

AUROC above 0.5 means hack turns project higher on the Assistant Axis. In the final region the association is not
distinguishable from random directions, and the norm of the mean residual alone separates the labels. In the CoT
region it is at the edge of the random-direction range.
